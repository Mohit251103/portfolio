            Hey there, I am Mohit Negi and I am a third year undergrad pursuing B.Tech. in Information Technology from JSS Academy Of Technical Education.<br /><br/>
            I have been coding for the past 2 to 3 years sometime learning Algorithms and sometime learning Web Development. Started with MERN stack and still learning it I have come a long way while wandering into the vasteness of tech world sometime. Learnt Nextjs after increasing familiarity with React and it turned out a lifesaver for some hectic scenarios of React for me. But obviously, React has its own set of pros. Out of curiosity I have tried ML during start of my second year and got the base knowledge of the algorithms and stuff in it. <br />
            Will try it in future :{" )"}.<br/><br/>
            Built some projects during this journey out of which some are displayed below.
